# Shared

## QsClass

QsClass serves as the foundation for all classes created with `lib.class`, offering core attributes and behaviors shared across classes.

### Attributes

- __className: `string`
  - A private field storing the class's name.
- initialize?: `function`
  - A private method for creating a new instance derived from a class.
  - Invoked by `class:new(...)` if `class:initialize()` is defined.
- privateData?: `table`
  - A private field containing all restricted data of a class.
  - Restricted data is inaccessible outside class methods, ensuring security and integrity.
  - Must be defined in the `initialize` method, even if no private properties are set.
- parent?: `class`
  - A private method pointing to the superclass's constructor.
  - Required to be called within a class's `initialize` method during instantiation.

## Classes

A class acts as a blueprint for generating objects with predefined properties and actions.

- While Lua doesn't natively support object-oriented programming, [metatables](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#2.4) can emulate it.
- Our class system draws inspiration from [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves grouping data (properties) and actions (methods) within a class.

This approach organizes related features, shields internal operations from external tampering, enhances modularity, protects data consistency, and manages how data is accessed or modified in a program.

### Inheritance

Classes can acquire properties and actions from other classes, much like instances inherit from their base class.

When defining a "parent" class in a class declaration, you create a "child" class. This child class inherits fields and methods from its parent, and this inheritance can span multiple levels of child classes, allowing shared properties across the class structure.

## lib.class

This method enables you to create a new class, optionally deriving from a parent class.

```lua
local NewClass = lib.class(className, parentClass)
```

### Parameters

- className: `string`
- parentClass?: `table`
  - Makes the new class a derivative of the parent class.

### Returns
- `table`
  - The newly defined class.

### Example

```lua
---@class Vehicle : QsClass
---@field model string
local Vehicle = lib.class('Vehicle')

function Vehicle:initialize(model)
    print('Initializing Vehicle with model:', model)
    self.model = model
end

-- Car Class (extends Vehicle)

---@class Car : Vehicle
---@field speed number
local Car = lib.class('Car', Vehicle)

function Car:initialize(model, speed)
    print('Initializing Car with model:', model)
    self:parent(model)
    self.speed = speed
end

function Car:displayInfo()
    print(("This is a %s traveling at %d mph."):format(self.model, self.speed))
end

function Car:upgradeSpeed(increase)
    self.speed = self.speed + increase
    print('New speed:', self.speed)
end

CreateThread(function()
    local sedan = Car:new('Sedan', 60)
    sedan:displayInfo()
    sedan:upgradeSpeed(20)
end)

-- Truck Class (extends Vehicle)

---@class Truck : Vehicle
---@field private privateData { capacity: number }
local Truck = lib.class('Truck', Vehicle)

---@param model string
---@param capacity number
function Truck:initialize(model, capacity)
    print('Initializing Truck with model:', model)
    self:parent(model)
    self.privateData.capacity = capacity
end

function Truck:displayInfo()
    print(("This %s truck has a capacity of %d tons."):format(self.model, self.privateData.capacity))
end

---@param capacity number
function Truck:setCapacity(capacity)
    self.privateData.capacity = capacity
end

CreateThread(function()
    local hauler = Truck:new('Hauler', 10)
    hauler:displayInfo() -- This Hauler truck has a capacity of 10 tons.
    hauler:setCapacity(15)
    hauler:displayInfo() -- This Hauler truck has a capacity of 15 tons.
    print(hauler.privateData.capacity) -- nil
    print(getmetatable(hauler.privateData)) -- privateData
    hauler.privateData.capacity = 20 -- error
end)
```
