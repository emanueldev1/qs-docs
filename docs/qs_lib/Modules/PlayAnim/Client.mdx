## lib.playAnim

Plays an animation on a ped with the specified parameters, handling the loading and unloading of the animation dictionary automatically. This function can serve as a direct replacement for `TaskPlayAnim`.

```lua
lib.playAnim(pedHandle, dict, anim, blendIn, blendOut, animDuration, flags, phaseStart, usePhase, controlOptions, skipCloneUpdate)
```

- pedHandle: `number`
  - The ped entity to play the animation on.
- dict: `string`
  - The animation dictionary name.
- anim: `string`
  - The name of the animation within the dictionary.
- blendIn?: `number`
  - Speed at which the animation blends in.
  - Default: `8.0`
- blendOut?: `number`
  - Speed at which the animation blends out.

- animDuration?: `number`
  - Duration in milliseconds for the animation; use `-1` to play until cancelled.

- flags?: `AnimationFlags`
  - Animation flags to control playback behavior.
  - Default: `0`
- phaseStart?: `number`
  - Starting point of the animation as a percentage (0.0 to 1.0).
  - Default: `0.0`
- usePhase?: `boolean`
  - Determines if `phaseStart` is applied.
  - Default: `false`

### Examples

#### Example 1: Character Waving Animation

Plays a waving animation on the player's ped with a loop flag.

```lua
local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
lib.playAnim(playerPed, "friends@frj@ig_1", "wave_a", 8.0, 8.0, -1, 1, 0.0, false, 0, false)
print("Playing wave animation!")
```

#### Example 2: Inspecting an Item

Plays an inspection animation on the player's ped with custom blend speeds and phase start.

```lua
local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
lib.playAnim(playerPed, "amb@world_human_inspect@male_a@base", "base", 4.0, 4.0, 3000, 0, 0.5, true, 0, false)
print("Inspecting item...")
```
