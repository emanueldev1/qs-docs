```lua
lib.getNearbyVehicles(location, searchRange, includeOwnVehicle)
```

- location: `vector3`
  - The position to search around.
- searchRange?: `number`
  - The maximum distance to search within.
  - Default: `2.0`
- includeOwnVehicle?: `boolean`
  - Whether to include the player's current vehicle in the search. Ignored on the server.
  - Default: `false`

**Returns:**

- vehicles: `{ vehicle: number, coords: vector3 }[]`

## Examples

### Example 1: Locking Nearby Vehicles

Finds all vehicles within 10.0 units of the player's position, excluding their own vehicle, and locks them.

```lua
local playerPos = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())
local nearbyVehicles = lib.getNearbyVehicles(playerPos, 10.0, false)

for _, vehicle in ipairs(nearbyVehicles) do
    LockVehicle(vehicle.vehicle)
    print("Locked vehicle at:", vehicle.coords.x, vehicle.coords.y, vehicle.coords.z)
end
if #nearbyVehicles == 0 then
    print("No vehicles found to lock nearby.")
end
```

### Example 2: Checking Nearby Vehicles for a Race Start

Locates all vehicles within the default range (2.0 units) from a race starting point, including the player's vehicle, and prepares them for a race.

```lua
local raceStart = vector3(600.0, 700.0, 80.0)
local raceVehicles = lib.getNearbyVehicles(raceStart, nil, true)

for _, vehicle in ipairs(raceVehicles) do
    PrepareVehicleForRace(vehicle.vehicle)
    print("Prepared vehicle for race at:", vehicle.coords.x, vehicle.coords.y, vehicle.coords.z)
end
if #raceVehicles == 0 then
    print("No vehicles found at the race start.")
end
```
