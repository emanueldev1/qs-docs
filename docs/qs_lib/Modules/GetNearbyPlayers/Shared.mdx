## lib.getNearbyPlayers

Obtains the ID, ped handle, and coordinates of all players within a specified range of a given position.

```lua
lib.getNearbyPlayers(location, searchRange, includeSelf)
```

- location: `vector3`
  - The position to search around.
- searchRange?: `number`
  - The maximum distance to search within.
  - Default: `2.0`
- includeSelf?: `boolean`
  - Whether to include the local player in the search. Ignored on the server.
  - Default: `false`

**Returns:**

- players: `{ id: number, ped: number, coords: vector3 }[]`

## Examples

### Example 1: Forming a Group with Nearby Players

Finds all players within 8.0 units of the player's position, excluding themselves, and invites them to form a group.

```lua
local playerPos = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())
local nearbyPlayers = lib.getNearbyPlayers(playerPos, 8.0, false)

for _, player in ipairs(nearbyPlayers) do
    InviteToGroup(player.id)
    print("Invited player", player.id, "at:", player.coords.x, player.coords.y, player.coords.z)
end
if #nearbyPlayers == 0 then
    print("No players found to invite nearby.")
end
```

### Example 2: Broadcasting a Message to Nearby Players

Locates all players within the default range (2.0 units) from a specific location, including the local player, and broadcasts a message to them.

```lua
local broadcastPoint = vector3(400.0, 500.0, 60.0)
local nearbyPlayers = lib.getNearbyPlayers(broadcastPoint, nil, true)

for _, player in ipairs(nearbyPlayers) do
    SendMessageToPlayer(player.id, "Event starting soon!")
    print("Sent message to player", player.id, "at:", player.coords.x, player.coords.y, player.coords.z)
end
if #nearbyPlayers == 0 then
    print("No players found to message nearby.")
end
```
