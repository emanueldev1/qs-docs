## Examples

### Example 1: Finding a Nearby Vehicle to Repair

Searches for the closest vehicle within 3.0 units of the player's position, excluding their own vehicle, and repairs it if found.

```lua
local playerPos = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())
local vehicle, vehiclePos = lib.getClosestVehicle(playerPos, 3.0, false)

if vehicle then
    RepairVehicle(vehicle)
    print("Repaired vehicle at:", vehiclePos.x, vehiclePos.y, vehiclePos.z)
else
    print("No vehicle found to repair nearby.")
end
```

### Example 2: Locating a Nearby Vehicle to Steal

Finds the closest vehicle within the default range (2.0 units) from a specific location, including the player's vehicle, and attempts to steal it if present.

```lua
local theftSpot = vector3(500.0, 600.0, 70.0)
local vehicle, vehiclePos = lib.getClosestVehicle(theftSpot, nil, true)

if vehicle then
    StealVehicle(vehicle)
    print("Attempting to steal vehicle at:", vehiclePos.x, vehiclePos.y, vehiclePos.z)
else
    print("No vehicle found to steal nearby.")
end
```
