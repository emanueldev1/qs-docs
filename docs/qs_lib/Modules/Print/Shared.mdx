## lib.print

Conditionally logs messages to the console based on configured levels, with color-coded and labeled outputs. The resource name is always included in the log.

```lua
lib.print.error(...)
lib.print.warn(...)
lib.print.info(...)
lib.print.verbose(...)
lib.print.debug(...)
```

- vararg: `any`
  - Content to log in the console. Tables are automatically formatted for readability.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Warning About High Latency

Logs a warning about high query latency with a specific value.

```lua
local latency = 120
lib.print.warn("query latency high: ", latency)
```

#### Example 2: Debugging Player Data

Logs detailed player data for debugging purposes.

```lua
local playerData = { id = 123, health = 80, position = vec3(100, 200, 30) }
lib.print.debug("player data:", playerData)
```

### Levels

Each print level serves a specific purpose and is color-coded for clarity. Below are the levels, their intended use, and examples.

- **Error**  
  Signals a critical failure in the system.  
  **Example 1:** Logging a database connection failure.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.error("Failed to connect to database: timeout")
  ```  
  **Example 2:** Reporting a resource initialization error.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.error("Resource failed to initialize: missing dependency")
  ```

- **Warn**  
  Highlights unexpected conditions that may lead to errors in the future.  
  **Example 1:** Warning about low server memory.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.warn("Server memory low:", GetServerMemoryUsage())
  ```  
  **Example 2:** Notifying about a deprecated function usage.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.warn("Using deprecated function: UpdatePlayerStats")
  ```

- **Info**  
  Provides details on significant, successful operations.  
  **Example 1:** Logging a successful player login.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.info("Player logged in: ID", 123)
  ```  
  **Example 2:** Confirming a resource has started.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.info("Resource started successfully:", GetCurrentResourceName())
  ```

- **Verbose**  
  Offers detailed insights into intermediate steps of operations.  
  **Example 1:** Logging a transaction process step.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.verbose("Processing transaction: deducting funds from player", 123)
  ```  
  **Example 2:** Detailing a data sync operation.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.verbose("Synchronizing player data with server:", playerData)
  ```

- **Debug**  
  Assists developers with in-depth system tracing; should be disabled outside debugging.  
  **Example 1:** Debugging a function's input parameters.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.debug("Function input:", inputParams)
  ```  
  **Example 2:** Tracing animation playback state.  
  ```lua
  lib.print.debug("Animation state:", animState)
  ```

### Configuration

Set the logging level using the following convars in your `server.cfg`. Only messages at or above the specified level will be logged. For example, setting the level to `info` will log `error`, `warn`, and `info`, but not `verbose` or `debug`. The default level is `info` if not set. Resource-specific levels override the global setting.

```bash
set qs:printlevel "info"
set qs:printlevel:qs_inventory "warn"
set qs:printlevel:<resourceName> "<level>"
```
