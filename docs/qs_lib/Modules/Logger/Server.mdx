# Server

## lib.logger

Records a log entry with specified details.

```lua
lib.logger(sourceId, eventName, logMessage, ...)
```

- sourceId: `number` | `string`
  - Typically a player ID, an identifier, or the origin of the event.
- eventName: `string`
  - A label for the log event, such as the triggering action or a description.
- logMessage: `string`
  - The main content of the log entry.
- vararg: `string`
  - Additional arguments to be used as tags for filtering and searching.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Logging a Player Transaction

Logs a player's transaction details, including the amount and item purchased.

```lua
local transaction = { playerId = 123, amount = 500, item = "Health Kit" }
lib.logger(123, "PlayerTransaction", json.encode(transaction), "Purchase", "Shop")
```

#### Example 2: Logging a Server Restart Event

Records a server restart event with the reason for the restart.

```lua
local restartDetails = { reason = "Scheduled Maintenance", timestamp = os.time() }
lib.logger(-1, "ServerRestart", json.encode(restartDetails), "Maintenance", "System")
```
