## Examples

### Example 1: Finding a Nearby Player to Trade With

Searches for the closest player within 4.0 units of the current player's position, excluding themselves, and initiates a trade if found.

```lua
local myPos = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())
local traderId, traderPed, traderPos = lib.getClosestPlayer(myPos, 4.0, false)

if traderId then
    StartTradeWithPlayer(traderId)
    print("Found player to trade with at:", traderPos.x, traderPos.y, traderPos.z)
else
    print("No player found to trade with nearby.")
end
```

### Example 2: Challenging a Nearby Player to a Duel

Finds the closest player within the default range (2.0 units) from a specific location, including the local player, and challenges them to a duel if present.

```lua
local duelSpot = vector3(300.0, 400.0, 50.0)
local opponentId, opponentPed, opponentPos = lib.getClosestPlayer(duelSpot, nil, true)

if opponentId then
    ChallengePlayerToDuel(opponentId)
    print("Challenged player at:", opponentPos.x, opponentPos.y, opponentPos.z)
else
    print("No player found to challenge for a duel.")
end
```
