# Fuel Bridge (Server)

<Alert variant="warning" className="mb-4">
  <AlertTitle>No Server-Side Functions Available</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    This bridge does not provide any server-side functions for fuel management. Please use the client-side fuel bridge functions, documented at <a href="/docs/qs_lib/Bridges/fuel/client">Fuel Bridge (Client)</a>, to manage vehicle fuel levels. The client-side functions are compatible by default with the following fuel systems: cdn-fuel, LegacyFuel, ox_fuel, ps-fuel, Renewed-Fuel, ti_fuel, and x-fuel.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

The Fuel Bridge on the server side currently does not offer any functional methods. All fuel management operations should be handled using the client-side functions.
