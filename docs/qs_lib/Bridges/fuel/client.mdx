# Fuel Bridge (Client)

<Alert variant="info" className="mb-4">
  <AlertTitle>Default Compatibility</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The functions listed below are compatible by default with the following fuel systems: cdn-fuel, LegacyFuel, ox_fuel, ps-fuel, Renewed-Fuel, ti_fuel, and x-fuel. These functions represent the complete set of client-side fuel operations provided by this bridge. Note that some functions, such as <code>lib.fuel.getFuel</code>, may not be fully supported in all fuel systems. In such cases, the function may provide micro-compatibility (e.g., returning a default value) or return <code>nil</code>.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

<Alert variant="info" className="mb-4">
  <AlertTitle>Detecting the Fuel system</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    You can determine the currently detected fuel system by accessing <code>lib.bridge.fuel</code>. This returns the fuel's identifier (e.g., "LegacyFuel", "ox_fuel", ...).
    ```lua title="Example: Checking Fuel Name"
    local fuel = lib.bridge.fuel
    print("Detected fuel:", fuel)
    ```
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

The Fuel Bridge provides functions to manage vehicle fuel levels on the client side, such as setting and retrieving fuel levels.

## lib.fuel.setFuel

Sets the fuel level for a vehicle.

```lua
lib.fuel.setFuel(veh, val)
```

- veh: `number` | `string`
  - The vehicle identifier (e.g., vehicle handle or ID).
- val: `number`
  - The fuel level to set (e.g., percentage or absolute value, such as `75` for 75%).

**Returns:**

- success: `boolean` | `nil`
  - `true` if the fuel level was set successfully, `false` or `nil` otherwise.

### Example: Setting Vehicle Fuel

Sets the fuel level of the player's current vehicle to 75%.

```lua title="Client: Setting Vehicle Fuel"
RegisterCommand('setfuel', function(source, args, rawCommand)
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
    if vehicle ~= 0 then
        local success = lib.fuel.setFuel(vehicle, 75)
        if success then
            print("Successfully set fuel level to 75% for vehicle:", vehicle)
        else
            print("Failed to set fuel level for vehicle:", vehicle)
        end
    else
        print("You are not in a vehicle.")
    end
end, false)
```

## lib.fuel.getFuel

Retrieves the fuel level of a vehicle.

```lua
lib.fuel.getFuel(veh)
```

- veh: `number` | `string`
  - The vehicle identifier (e.g., vehicle handle or ID).

**Returns:**

- fuelLevel: `number` | `nil`
  - The current fuel level of the vehicle (e.g., `75` for 75%), or `nil` if not available.

### Example: Checking Vehicle Fuel

Fetches and logs the fuel level of the player's current vehicle.

```lua title="Client: Checking Vehicle Fuel"
RegisterCommand('getfuel', function(source, args, rawCommand)
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
    if vehicle ~= 0 then
        local fuelLevel = lib.fuel.getFuel(vehicle)
        if fuelLevel then
            print("Current fuel level for vehicle", vehicle, ":", fuelLevel, "%")
        else
            print("Failed to retrieve fuel level for vehicle:", vehicle)
        end
    else
        print("You are not in a vehicle.")
    end
end, false)
```
